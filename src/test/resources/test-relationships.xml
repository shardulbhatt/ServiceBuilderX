    <!--
        <relation> element provides following attributes:
        
        "one" : the type of the entity representing the ONE end of the relation.
        
        "many" : the type of the entity representing the MANY end of the relation 
        
        "collection" : the type of the collection holding the type of entities 
        represented by the MANY end of the relation.
        
        TODO:  "collection" attribute should also be optional because in case
        oneToOne is specified as true, this attribute's value can be ignored.
        Work on it later.
        
        Following are the OPTIONAL attributes holding a boolean value "true"
        or "false".
         
        "bidirectional" : for specifying if the relationship is bidirectional 
        or not.That is the related entities can be obtained from the either end 
        of the relation.
        
        "oneToOne" : Use a "true" value for specifying the relationship as 
        ONE-to-ONE.That is the type of the entity specified by attribute
        "one" and the type of the entity specified by attribute "many" are 
        defined by a ONE-to-ONE relation.
        
        "manyToMany" : Use a "true" value for specifying the relationship as
